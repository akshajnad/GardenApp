      Akshaj, a senior at South Windsor High School, created Verdant to combine his passions for machine learning, agriculture, and community service. Having grown and donated produce to shelters in the past, Akshaj saw the potential to simplify gardening and expand its impact through technology. Verdant reflects this mission, empowering users to cultivate sustainable green spaces with ease. Beyond this project, Akshaj is dedicated to using technology to drive positive change and support community-focused initiatives.
