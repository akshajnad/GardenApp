<h2>Welcome to GardenApp</h2>
<p>
  This is our extended "About Us" section, describing how GardenApp supports shelters
  by providing a platform to request fresh produce. 
</p>
<p>
  We connect local farmers or community gardens with shelters in need, helping them
  plan, plant, and harvest produce efficiently. Once you submit a request, our admin team
  can create a customized planting schedule. 
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Interested in registering?</strong> Please reach out to us directly so we can
  establish a relationship. We want to ensure that each shelter is onboarded properly.
</p>
<p>
  After you're registered, you can log in and submit requests for produce, specifying
  how many people you serve, any special dietary needs, etc. We'll handle the rest!
</p>
